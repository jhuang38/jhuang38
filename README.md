#### Heyo! ðŸ‘‹ I'm James, a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

-  I've previously interned at Newfront, PayPal, and BMO Capital Markets as a Software Engineering Intern, mainly focusing on backend/infrastructure work.
-  The main languages I'm familiar with are TypeScript, Python, Rust, C++,  and Java!
-  My main interests are in backend/infrastructure development, but I'm always looking to learn new things! Currently trying to spec into distributed systems and AI :)
-  Feel free to reach out to me at j528huan@uwaterloo.ca
